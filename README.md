# SmileyFaceEngine
A game engine for building games in a C# Console Application.

This is a C# library that help in the creation of multiple game types using a C# Console Application.

Features:
The library currenty handles the game loop as well as input. 
It will contain the ability to handle game state, but will not require you to have multiple states.  
The game states that it supports currently are Play, Pause, Menu, Lose, and Win.  
The engine currently supports the ability to draw in color (This is still very slow at the moment).
The game currently can handle and detect collision (this is not an event however)


Future Features:
Increase performance for the use of Color.
Create a better map generator.
Allow for larger worlds that will move as if looking through a camera.
Add physics for platform games

Please let me know if there is anything else that you would like to see in this engine.  I am just doing this currently
as a side project. However, if people see this as something fun that they can use, I would be happy to put more effort
behind the project.  As it stands updates will most likely be weekly.

Thanks,
:)
